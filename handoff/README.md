# LikelySnap Handoff

This folder contains the working handoff for the macOS-first LikelySnap改造.

Read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CURRENT_GOAL.md`
3. `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
4. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
5. `RECORDING_PACKAGE_PLAN.md`
6. `AUDIO_VIDEO_SYNC_INVESTIGATION.md`
7. `REMAINING_ISSUES_AND_TODOS.md`
8. `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`
9. `MACOS_PERMISSION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

The central direction is final-product repair, not temporary workaround:

- recording directory must be user selectable;
- long recordings must continuously write to disk;
- new recordings are a single `.likelysnap` package while keeping internal files streamable;
- media must be recoverable after crashes;
- macOS audio/video sync must be measurable and fixed;
- cursor telemetry must remain aligned so auto zoom and Follow Mouse do not regress;
- settings must be persistent, wired to real behavior, and available from both the launch HUD and editor without relying on transparent-overlay modals;
- app branding and icon assets must come from reproducible project files, not one-off generated output.
- edited MP4 export now uses the FFmpeg frame-streaming path as the primary MP4 backend; GIF export and the old WebCodecs/BufferTarget exporter remain compatibility/legacy paths.
- long-recording editor open is now staged: preview cursor data, idle waveform preparation, idle auto zoom, and cursor parse caching should keep the editor interactive while background jobs continue.
- packaged macOS permission issues have a recorded troubleshooting path in `MACOS_PERMISSION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`; do not confuse dev-app permission success with packaged-app TCC/LaunchServices state.
